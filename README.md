# Project-5__Prediction-of-house-prices-Kaggle-data

In the Jupyter notebook I predict house prices based on a set of features such as the number of bedrooms. The data is obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

Target variable:

SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. 

The features are described in the "data_description.txt" file, and the latter file is included in the "data" folder. For the sake of brevity, I do not report the description of the features here, and I refer the reader to the "data_description.txt" file for the description of all the features.

Some of the (regression) tecniques that I use to predict house prices are:

Lasso regression;

Ridge regression;

SVR (Support Vector Regression);

Random Forest Regression;

Polynomial Lasso regression.
